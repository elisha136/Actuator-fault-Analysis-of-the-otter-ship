# Actuator Fault Analysis of the Otter Ship

This repository contains a MATLAB-based analysis of actuator faults in the Otter vessel. Our main goal is to demonstrate how to detect and estimate actuator faults using an Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (AEKF).

## Project Overview

- **Matlab Code**: The file `m4.m` implements the Otterâ€™s dynamic model, introduces actuator faults, and applies the AEKF for fault diagnosis.
- **Report**: The PDF (`AIS4004_Individual_Portfolio.pdf`) discusses the theoretical background, methodology, and results of the simulation.

## Key Features

1. **Otter Vessel Model**: A 3-DOF representation capturing surge, sway, and yaw dynamics.
2. **Cosine-Blending Control**: Smoothly varying control inputs to reduce transient effects.
3. **Fault Injection**: Scheduled changes in actuator effectiveness to simulate faults.
4. **AEKF Implementation**: An extended Kalman filter that adaptively estimates both states and fault parameters.

## How to Run

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elisha136/Actuator-fault-Analysis-of-the-otter-ship.git
   Open m4.m in MATLAB (or MATLAB Online).
   ```

Run the script to generate plots and observe fault estimation performance.

Refer to the PDF (AIS4004_Individual_Portfolio.pdf) for a comprehensive explanation of the results.
